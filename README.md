# Data Cleaning with Pandas

This Jupyter Notebook contains a simple data cleaning process performed on a customer call list dataset using **Pandas**.

## Cleaning steps

- **Removing duplicates** and unnecessary columns  
- **Standardizing column values**, such as:  
  - Stripping unwanted characters from names  
  - Formatting phone numbers  
  - Replacing categorical fields with consistent values
- **Splitting address information** into separate columns (street, state, zip code)  
- **Handling missing values** by filling empty fields or removing incomplete rows  
- **Filtering out rows** where customers should not be contacted or phone numbers are missing  

## Result

The final result is a structured dataset ready for further analysis or use.
